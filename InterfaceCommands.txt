Commands:

InitialIN:
	- Calls the InitialInput() method in Processor

OpenDECK:
	- Creates a DEUCECardReader class and then calls its loadDeck(FixedCardDeck deck) function, with the user's object passed in as the deck.
	- (Or maybe just calls the DEUCECardReader constructor which takes a deck as an argument?) 
	
LoadFile: 
	- Makes CRDFileReader, reads in and creates deck and then creates said ddeck.
