Visitor at Exhibition:

-As a visitor,
I should be able to choose a program to run,
So I can see the DEUCE work through different problems

- As a visitor,
I should be able to clear the state of the machine, (Clear OS key on control planel)
So I can load a new program

- As a visitor, 
I should be able to see the output of a program on the control panel,
In case I don't want the computer "punching cards"

- As a visitor, 
I should be able to input something to DL0 with the ID lamps,
So that I can see the change in memory

- As a visitor, 
I should be able to clear the ID lamps with the Clear ID key,
So I don't need to change each digit by hand if I made a mistake

- As a visitor,
I should be able to step through a program using the stop key,
So I can see the changes in memory as it progresses

- As a visitor,
I should be able to step through a program using the one-shot dial,
So I can control the pace of the program

-As a visitor,
I should be able to return the stop key to its "up" position,
So the program can return to running at its intended speed.

- As a visitor, 
I should be able to switch between Delay Lines,
So I can see what changes in different parts of memory

- As a visitor,
I should be able to clear the "alarum",
So that I can continue running a program after a stopper has been reached

- As a visitor, 
I should NOT be able to stop or step through a program when the reader or writer are on,
So that I can't disturb the results of a carefully made program

- As a visitor,
I should be able to use the External Tree key to have the program use my inputs,
So I can see what happens to a program with a different ordering of instructions

Programmer:

Program should

- Read through all instructions, storing them in memory
	- Get string
	- Split up into parts of instruction word
- Then read in DATA
	- Perhaps just do this by having an END?
	- But how did reading in data work?
		- Sources say was done in decimal...
		- So maybe have separate DATA cards?
 			- Could "cheat" here, I suppose...
- Then start executing
	- 1)Start at DL0, word0, I suppose
	- 2)Then, "get" NIS + time (time increments counter)
	- 3)repeat 2)

-Generally a large SWITCH statement for all arithmetic, logic, etc.
-Otherwise, simply transferring between places in memory.
